# bigforecast

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create an automated system which produces near-term forecasts of globally important economic / financial time series. The system will create features from a wide variety of data sources and create forecasts using an ensemble of time series models. We will exploit distributed compute and storage technologies to build a system which is always on, evaluating new potential features and constantly updating the deployed forecasting model. We will begin with the daily spot price of crude oil, but hope to expand to other important series.
