Notes for Demo

Assumes all the Demo files are on remote server


SETUP - Box
- these scripts assume certail packages are installed:
[code] pip install influxdb
[code] sudo pip install numpy
[code] sudo pip install pandas
[code] pip install -U statsmodels
[code] pip install -U scikit-learn
[code] pip install python-c

SETUP - Data
- create a file named stockdatafordemo.csv on the instance (the main script looks for a .csv file)
- copy and paste raw sample data from stockdatafordemo.txt from github
- Start influx db in the background type: 
	- [code] influxd &
- Create a new database called mydb and exit:
	- [code] create database mydb
	- [code] exit
- run CSVtoInfluxForDemo.py to populate the database, the table/measure we populate is called "stockpricedemo" 
- run the predict function in the StockPriceDemo file using this code (you can play around with predict, just take a look at its arguements)
  it currently defaults to something that works well if you pass in the following:
	- [code] python-c StockPriceDemo 'predict(["VAR1"], ticker = "goog")'
	- [code] python-c StockPriceDemo 'predict(["VAR1"])'
	- [code] python-c StockPriceDemo 'predict()'
